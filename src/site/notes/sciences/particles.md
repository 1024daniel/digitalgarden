## 基本粒子定义和相关概念
1. elemental particles :
	cannot be further broken down into smaller particles
2. elemental particles in standard model :
	quarks, leptons, bosons
3. quarks :
	smallest particles ever known, there are 6 flavours of quarks:up,down,top,bottom,strange,charm, combines to form nucleons which make up nucleus of an atom. The [rest masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_mass "Rest mass") of quarks contribute only about 1% of a proton's mass.[[11\|11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton#cite_note-Mass-11) The remainder of a proton's mass is due to [quantum chromodynamics binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics_binding_energy "Quantum chromodynamics binding energy"), which includes the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of the quarks and the energy of the [gluon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon") fields that bind the quarks together.
4. fermions 
	:quarks and leptons, with half integer number spin, fermions obey Pauli Exclusion Principle. fermions make up matter.
5. bosons
	:with integer number spin, does not obey Pauli Exclusion Principle, act as force carriers causing interactions between other particles like quarks and leptons.For example, photons, gluons. photons causes electromagnetic interactions, gluons act as force carries between quarks creating one of elemental nature force: strong force
6. baryons
	:particles that have no less mass than protons, made up by 3 quarks, bosons
7. mesons
	: particles that have less mass than protons, make up by 2 quarks quark and  an antiquark pair, fermions
8. hadrons
	: baryons and mesons, composite subatomic particles that are made up by quarks
9. leptons
	: the matter outside a nucleus is made up of leptons, electrons muons, tau, neutrinos. electrons, muons and tau are negative charged, with distinct mass
	
10. photon
	:is consider a packet of energy with no resting mass, which means light has press when photon go on light speed.
11. electron
	:a dimensionless point.
	
>.In QED, a particle need to spin 720 degrees to get back to origin state unlike normal word. with only 360 spin it get into a twist state
particles do not spin like normal world, we use spin to define the intrinsic property of particles just because the charged particles behave like it has spin which make it a magnet,  
but as we know particles like electron should spin faster than speed of light to make such magnet power.

12. nuclear fusion
	:release bind energy, as bind-energy is negative to the mass of atoms, no particles disappear.
13. annihilation
	: particles collide with its antiparticles will produces photons(energy). the conversion of matter into energy, especially the mutual conversion of a particle and an antiparticle into electromagnetic radiation.
14. mass:
	You have to accept that mass actually is energy. Just energy trapped in a form from which it cannot be easily extracted. So the vast majority of the mass of an atom is actually energy “trapped” by holding together the quarks that form it.
	When fusion occurs, say between two deuterium atoms to form helium (I know that doesn’t happen directly, but assume it does), the quarks that formed the two atoms, clustered into protons and neutrons, find that they can snuggle together a bit more tightly as a helium nucleus than they could as two deuterium nuclei. So they emit some energy that they no longer need as they cluster just slightly more closely together.
	And that energy is mass. Not is converted from mass. When it was stuck inside the deuterium atoms, we saw it as mass, because we couldn’t access it. But when it escaped, we saw it as energy. But when it escaped, the remaining mass/energy of the nucleus decreased. And we saw that as a loss of mass.
