## 基本粒子定义
elemental particles
	:cannot be further broken down into smaller particles
elemental particles in standard model
	:quarks, leptons, bosons
quarks
	:smallest particles ever known, there are 6 types of quarks:up,down,top,bottom,strange,charm, combines to form nucleons which make up nucleus of an atom
fermions 
	:quarks and leptons, with half integer number spin, fermions obey Pauli Exclusion Principle. fermions make up matter.
bosons
	:with integer number spin, does not obey Pauli Exclusion Principle, act as force carriers causing interactions between other particles like quarks and leptons.For example, photons, gluons. photons causes electromagnetic interactions, gluons act as force carries between quarks creating one of elemental nature force: strong force
baryons
	:particles that have no less mass than protons
mesons
	: particles that have less mass than protons, make up by 2 quarks quark and  an antiquark pair
hadrons
	: baryons and mesons
leptons
	: the matter outside a nucleus is made up of leptons, electrons muons, tau, neutrinos. electrons, muons and tau are negative charged, with distinct mass
	
photon
	:is consider a packet of energy with no resting mass, which means light has press when photon go on light speed.
electron
	:a dimensionless point.
	
>.In QED, a particle need to spin 720 degrees to get back to origin state unlike normal word. with only 360 spin it get into a twist state
particles do not spin like normal world, we use spin to define the intrinsic property of particles just because the charged particles behave like it has spin which make it a magnet,  
but as we know particles like electron should spin faster than speed of light to make such magnet power.

nuclear fusion
	:release bind energy, as bind-energy is negative to the mass of atoms, no particles disappear.
annihilation
	: particles collide with its antiparticles will produces photons(energy). the conversion of matter into energy, especially the mutual conversion of a particle and an antiparticle into electromagnetic radiation.
